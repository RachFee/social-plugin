This plugin is a work in progress. Using Maps API, Facebook Graph API, and Twitter PHP SDK, it displays a grid of 6 most recent Twitter and Facebook posts, as well as a map. FB link, Twitter handle, and map address (amongst other custom settings), are available to be customized in the admin. 

My focus is primarily back-end development, so that is the main focus of this demo. I have added some front-end, however I acknowledge that it is not (yet) perfect, and will continue to be updated. At this point, my front-end focus is to make the display responsive, fix a some small display bugs with margins, and allow it to fit nicely within different column sizes and themes. **At this point, it has not been tested with themes outside TwentySixteen.**

A full list of known issues and planned updates are available under the issues tab.
